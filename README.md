As A business owner, I created a database that allows me to view and manage my growing company's assets including roles, departments, and employees in order to organize and plan my business.

I created a command-line application that accepts user input.

When the application is started, the user is presented with options to view departments, roles, and employees.
Functions were created to allow the user to also add departments, roles, and employees.

When the user chooses to view all departments, they are presetted with a table showing department names and IDs

When the user chooses to view all roles, they are presented with the job title, role id, the department the roll belings to, and salary for the roll

When the user chooses view all employees, they are presented witha table of employee data showing, employee id, first name, last name and job title, department, salary and direct supervisor.

When the user selects add a department, the are prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database.

When the user chooses add a role, they are prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database.

When the user selects add an employee, they are prompted to enter the employee's first name, last name, role and manager, and that employee is added to the database.
